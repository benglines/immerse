## Log

### Week 1: APRIL 26, 2021

* **Monday**:
  * Set up office space.
  * Met with Dallin and Jordi to start with SpyDrNet.
  * Attended BootCamp meeting.
* **Tuesday**: 
  * Installed Ubuntu on new office machine and set up environment.
  * Made this website. :)
  * Setup SSH for remote work.
  * Added my website link to Computing Boot Camp website.
  * Learned a lot about Python virtual environments, very helpful for not breaking stuff. 
  * Started trying to understand pytest. Will probably spend more time on this another day.
  * Got Vivado up and running on my machine.
  * Created a small design with an AND gate module instanced two times inside a top module.
  * Generated edif file in the TCL console with `write_edif my_netlist.edif` and opened it up in SpyDrNet to try and make sense of it.
* **Wednesday**: 
  * Reinstalled Project X-Ray and got it running correctly. Found an issue with a "resources.yaml" file that should be generated automatically, but for some reason did not generate for me, so I will create an issue on the Project X-Ray page.
  * Got Bit Inspector working again with the simple andgate design I made earlier. I could probably simplify the code that is contained in Bit Inspector before handing it off, could make the design easier to read.
  * Changed presentation from last year to reflect progress with the Bit Inspector tool. Since the Bit Inspector tool hadn't been finished yet when I gave the presentation, I basically changed most of the presentation to talk about that instead of the modified bit2fasm tool I was working on. The presentation is mostly ready, but still needs some work.
* **Thursday**: 
  * Started working Python tutorials from here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/. Did Section 1-4.6, and feel more confident now. I plan on working through the rest of the tutorials later
  
* **Friday**:
